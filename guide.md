Of course! That's a fantastic and very practical approach for development and testing. Using local static data is a common practice to build out functionality without relying on a live (and sometimes problematic) API.

Here is a complete guide on how to structure your project and modify the code to use your downloaded JSON files.

### **Step 1: Organize Your Local Data Files**

First, let's create a dedicated folder for your data to keep the project clean.

1.  **Create a `data` directory:** In your `fpl-dashboard` project folder, create a new directory named `data`.

    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the 'fpl-dashboard' directory
    mkdir data
    ```

2.  **Place your main JSON files:**
    *   Take your JSON file that contains the output from the `bootstrap-static` API call and save it inside the `data` folder as `bootstrap-static.json`.
    *   Take your JSON file that contains the output from the `leagues-classic/{LID}/standings` API call and save it inside the `data` folder as `league-standings.json`.

3.  **Handle the Manager Picks (The Tricky Part):**
    The `entry/{entry_id}/event/{gameweek}/picks` call is dynamic. You likely have multiple JSON files, one for each manager for a specific gameweek. We'll create a sub-folder to organize these.

    *   Create a `picks` sub-directory inside `data`:
        ```bash
        mkdir data/picks
        ```
    *   For **each manager** in your league, for **each gameweek** you want to test, save their picks JSON file inside `data/picks/` using a clear naming convention: `manager_{manager_id}_gw_{gameweek}.json`.

    For example, for manager ID `12345` and gameweek `38`, the file would be named: `manager_12345_gw_38.json`.

Your final project structure should look like this:

```
fpl-dashboard/
├── venv/
├── data/
│   ├── bootstrap-static.json
│   ├── league-standings.json
│   └── picks/
│       ├── manager_12345_gw_38.json
│       ├── manager_67890_gw_38.json
│       └── ... (and so on for other managers/gameweeks)
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
└── .gitignore
```

### **Step 2: Modify `app.py` to Load Local Data**

Now, we'll edit `app.py`. The best way to do this is to add a simple "switch" at the top of the file that lets you toggle between using the live API and your local data.

Here are the changes for each function. I will provide the full, final code at the end.

1.  **Add a Control Switch and `json` import:** At the top of `app.py`, add `import json` and a master switch variable.

    ```python
    import streamlit as st
    import requests
    import pandas as pd
    import time
    import json # <<< ADD THIS LINE

    # --- Configuration ---
    # Master switch to toggle between live API and local JSON files
    USE_LOCAL_DATA = True # <<< ADD THIS LINE
    ```

2.  **Modify `get_fpl_data()`:** We'll add an `if/else` block based on our switch.

    ```python
    @st.cache_data(ttl=900)
    def get_fpl_data():
        """Fetches general FPL data from local file or live API."""
        if USE_LOCAL_DATA:
            with open("data/bootstrap-static.json", "r") as f:
                return json.load(f)
        else:
            response = requests.get(BOOTSTRAP_STATIC_URL)
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response.json()
    ```

3.  **Modify `get_league_data()`:** Same logic here.

    ```python
    @st.cache_data(ttl=900)
    def get_league_data(league_id):
        """Fetches league standings from local file or live API."""
        if USE_LOCAL_DATA:
            with open("data/league-standings.json", "r") as f:
                return json.load(f)
        else:
            response = requests.get(LEAGUE_URL.format(league_id=league_id))
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response.json()
    ```

4.  **Modify `get_manager_team()`:** This one is slightly different as it constructs the filename dynamically.

    ```python
    @st.cache_data(ttl=900)
    def get_manager_team(manager_id, gameweek):
        """Fetches a manager's team for a gameweek from local file or live API."""
        if USE_LOCAL_DATA:
            filepath = f"data/picks/manager_{manager_id}_gw_{gameweek}.json"
            try:
                with open(filepath, "r") as f:
                    return json.load(f)
            except FileNotFoundError:
                st.error(f"Local file not found: {filepath}")
                return None
        else:
            url = ENTRY_EVENT_URL.format(entry_id=manager_id, gameweek=gameweek)
            try:
                response = requests.get(url)
                response.raise_for_status()
                return response.json()
            except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
                st.error(f"Could not fetch data for manager {manager_id} in GW{gameweek}: {e}")
                return None
    ```

### **Step 3: The Complete, Modified `app.py` File**

Here is the entire script with all the changes integrated. You can replace the contents of your `app.py` with this.

```python
import streamlit as st
import requests
import pandas as pd

# --- Configuration ---

### How to Revert to Live Data

When the new season starts and you want your app to use live data again, all you have to do is change one line at the top of `app.py`:

```python
# Change this:
USE_LOCAL_DATA = True

# To this:
USE_LOCAL_DATA = False
```

Your app will now seamlessly switch back to calling the FPL API. This is a much cleaner approach than commenting/uncommenting large blocks of code.



Excellent! Getting your app ready for the world is the most exciting part. I'll guide you through this process step-by-step, providing the exact Mac commands and explaining the concepts as we go.

This process has two main phases:
1.  **Publishing your code to GitHub.**
2.  **Deploying your app from GitHub to Streamlit Community Cloud.**

---

### **Part 1: Publishing Your Project to GitHub**

Your code currently lives only on your Mac. To deploy it, Streamlit Community Cloud needs to access it from a central location, which is what GitHub is for.

**Prerequisites:**
*   You need a free GitHub account. If you don't have one, sign up at [github.com](https://github.com).
*   You should have Git installed. Since you're on a Mac and have used `xcode-select`, you already have it.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1.  **Create a New Repository on GitHub:**
    *   Go to your GitHub profile and click the `+` icon in the top-right corner, then select **"New repository"**.
    *   **Repository name:** `fpl-dashboard` (or another name you prefer).
    *   **Description:** (Optional) "A Streamlit dashboard for my FPL mini-league."
    *   **Public/Private:** Select **Public**. Public repositories are required for the free tier of Streamlit Community Cloud.
    *   **Do NOT initialize** with a README, .gitignore, or license. We will add these files from your local machine.
    *   Click **"Create repository"**.

2.  **Initialize Git in Your Local Project Folder:**
    *   Open your Terminal and make sure you are in your project directory:
      ```bash
      cd /path/to/your/fpl-dashboard
      ```
    *   Now, initialize a Git repository. This command creates a hidden `.git` folder that will track all your changes.
      ```bash
      git init -b main
      ```
      *(The `-b main` part sets the default branch name to `main`, which is the new standard instead of `master`.)*

3.  **Check Your `.gitignore` File:**
    *   This file is crucial. It tells Git which files or folders to ignore. Open your `.gitignore` file and ensure it contains at least the following to avoid uploading your virtual environment:
      ```
      # Python virtual environment
      venv/
      .venv/

      # Python cache files
      __pycache__/
      *.pyc
      ```
    *   **Important:** Make sure your `data/` folder is **NOT** in the `.gitignore` file. We need to upload the local JSON files so the deployed app can use them.

4.  **Add and Commit Your Files:**
    *   Add all your project files (except the ignored ones) to Git's staging area.
      ```bash
      git add .
      ```
    *   Commit the files. A commit is like a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. The `-m` flag lets you add a descriptive message.
      ```bash
      git commit -m "Initial commit of FPL dashboard application"
      ```

5.  **Connect Your Local Repo to GitHub and Push:**
    *   On the GitHub page you created in Step 1, you'll see a section titled "...or push an existing repository from the command line". Copy the two commands from there. They will look like this:
      ```bash
      # First, connect your local repo to the remote one on GitHub
      git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/fpl-dashboard.git

      # Then, push your 'main' branch to the remote repository named 'origin'
      git push -u origin main
      ```
    *   Paste these commands into your terminal and run them. You might be prompted for your GitHub username and password (or a personal access token).

**Success!** If you refresh your GitHub repository page, you will now see all your files (`app.py`, `requirements.txt`, the `data` folder, etc.). Your code is now published and ready for deployment.

---

### **Part 2: Deploying to Streamlit Community Cloud**

Now we'll tell Streamlit where to find your code and how to run it.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1.  **Sign Up/Log In to Streamlit Community Cloud:**
    *   Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io).
    *   Click **"Continue with GitHub"** to sign up or log in. This is the easiest way as it automatically links your accounts. Authorize Streamlit to access your repositories.

2.  **Deploy the App:**
    *   Once logged in, you'll be on your workspace. Click the **"New app"** button in the top-right corner.
    *   This will open the "Deploy an app" page. Fill it out as follows:
        *   **Repository:** Click the dropdown and select your new `fpl-dashboard` repository. If you don't see it, you may need to click "Connect to GitHub" and grant access to that specific repository.
        *   **Branch:** It should automatically select `main`. Leave it as is.
        *   **Main file path:** This should be `app.py`. Streamlit is usually smart enough to find it.
        *   **App URL:** (Optional) You can give your app a custom URL, like `your-name-fpl-dash.streamlit.app`.

3.  **Advanced Settings (Optional but Good Practice):**
    *   Click on **"Advanced settings..."** at the bottom.
    *   **Python version:** It's a good habit to select the Python version you used for development (e.g., 3.11). This ensures consistency between your local machine and the deployment environment.
    *   **Secrets:** You don't need this right now because you are using local data and have no API keys. But when you switch to the live API and need to log in to FPL, you would store your credentials here.

4.  **Launch!**
    *   Click the **"Deploy!"** button.

You will now be taken to a new screen where your app is "baking". You can see the logs in real-time as Streamlit:
1.  Creates a virtual environment (a container).
2.  Installs the packages from your `requirements.txt` file.
3.  Runs your `app.py` script.

This process might take a few minutes. Once it's done, your FPL dashboard will be live on the internet for you to share with your league mates!

---

### **Going Live: The Workflow for the New Season**

When the FPL season starts and you want to switch to the live API, your workflow will be incredibly simple:

1.  **Local Change:** Open `app.py` on your Mac and change the switch:
    ```python
    USE_LOCAL_DATA = False
    ```
2.  **Add Secrets (if needed):** If your live logic requires FPL login, go to your app's dashboard on `share.streamlit.io`, go to **Settings > Secrets**, and add your credentials there.
3.  **Commit & Push:** In your terminal, commit and push this one-line change:
    ```bash
    git add app.py
    git commit -m "feat: Switch to live FPL API for new season"
    git push
    ```

Streamlit Community Cloud will automatically detect the push to your `main` branch, and your live app will update itself within a minute. You don't need to redeploy manually.
